# TrackingExpenses
App that allows users to input the amount of money they spend and see how much they have spent over the last thirty days.

This app uses a csv file to keep track of your spendings. Before running, make sure that the python file and the csv file are in the same directory. Upon starting, the app will check if there are any missing days and automatically add them to the csv file.

In order to run this python file, you need to have installed the libraries being used.

To install matplotlib and pandas, go into the command prompt and type:
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install pandas
